# Why is Interaction Important?

- A single static picture is insufficient for understanding complex subjects
- Analyst needs to see different aspects and perspectives of data
- Interaction allows users to:
  - Select data components and subsets for viewing
  - Select and tune visualization techniques
  - Transform views and transform data
  - Perform analytical operations


---

# Types of Interaction with Visualizations

1. Changing data representation
2. Focusing and getting details
3. Data transformation
4. Data selection and filtering
5. Finding corresponding information in multiple views

<!-- These five categories represent the main ways users interact with visualizations. Each serves different analytical purposes and enables different types of insights. -->

---

<!-- _class: chapter -->
<!-- _paginate: skip -->

# 1. Interaction for Changing Data Representation

<!-- This section focuses on how users can change how data is represented visually -->

---

# Changing Visual Representation

- Allows viewing same data from different perspectives
- Supports different analytical tasks
- Examples:
  - From time plot to 2D time chart (linear vs. cyclic time)
  - From bar graph to pie chart (comparison vs. part-to-whole)
  - From position-based encoding to color-based encoding

<!-- Changing visual representation helps users see data from different task-specific perspectives. Different visualizations reveal different patterns and relationships in the data. -->

---

# Example: Different Time Perspectives

<div class="columns-2">

<div>

**Linear time view**
- Shows complete timeline
- Reveals overall trends
- Good for long-term patterns

![center](img/DVVA_11/temperature-anomaly.png)

</div>

<div>

**Cyclic time view**
- Shows monthly/yearly cycles
- Reveals seasonal patterns
- Good for periodic analysis

![center width:300](img/DVVA_11/temperature-anomaly-radial.png)

</div>

</div>

<!-- These examples show how the same data can be represented differently - as a continuous timeline or as a cyclical pattern - revealing different aspects of temporal data. -->

---

# Display Modification Operations

<div class="columns-2">
<div>

- Change display size and aspect ratio
- Adjust scales and color schemes
- Modify class intervals
- Change other visualization parameters
- Switch between different chart types

</div>
<div>

</div>
<div>

<!-- These operations help adjust visual representations to better suit properties of the data, display medium capabilities, and specific analysis tasks. -->

# 2. Interaction for Focusing and Getting Details

<!-- This section covers interaction techniques that allow users to focus on specific data and reveal more detailed information -->

---

# Accessing Exact Data Values

<div class="columns-2">
<div>

- Standard tooltip functionality
- Popup windows activated by pointing/hovering
- Can include:
  - Data values
  - Additional contextual information
  - References
  - Calculation details
  - Sub-visualizations
</div>
<div>
<div>

  <div class="interactive-chart" id="tooltip">
  </div>

  <div class="img-chart">
  <img src="img/DVVA_11/tooltips.png" alt=""/>
  </div>

  </div>
  <script>
  insertChart('tooltip', './chart/DVVA_11/tooltip.json', '100%', '450px');
  </script>

</div>
</div>
</div>


<!-- Access to exact values is a fundamental interaction feature that bridges the gap between visual representation and precise numeric information. -->

---

# Zooming and Panning

- Enlarge contiguous parts of the display
- Increase visual resolution of selected data
- Types:
  - Geometric zoom (simple magnification)
  - Semantic zoom (shows more detail at higher zoom levels)
  - Focus+context techniques (distortion-based approaches)

<!-- Zooming and panning allow users to navigate large datasets by focusing on areas of interest while maintaining awareness of the overall context. -->

---

# Color Re-scaling

<div class="columns-2">

<div>

**Techniques:**
- Focus full color scale on a selected range
- Visual comparison with reference value
- Convert sequential to diverging scale
- Discretization (class intervals)

**Applications:**
- Increase discrimination in specific value ranges
- Highlight deviations from reference
- Emphasize important thresholds
- Simplify complex continuous distributions

</div>

<div>

<div>
  <div class="interactive-chart" id="color-rescaling">

  </div>
  <script>
  insertChart('color-rescaling', './chart/DVVA_11/map_color_scales.json', '100%', '450px');
  </script>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<!-- Color re-scaling techniques help users better perceive and analyze value differences in specific ranges or in relation to reference values. -->

---

# Reordering

<div class="columns-2">
<div>

- Applied to matrices, tables, and charts
- Reveals relationships between attributes
- Examples:
  - Sorting table rows/columns
  - Reordering parallel coordinates axes
  - Arranging scatterplot matrix components
  - Ordering segments in pie charts

</div>
<div>

  <div class="interactive-chart" id="stacked_ordered">
  </div>

  <div class="img-chart">
  <img src="img/DVVA_11/stacked_ordered.png" alt=""/>
  </div>

  </div>
  <script>
  insertChart('stacked_ordered', './chart/DVVA_11/stacked_ordered.json', '100%', '450px');
  </script>

</div>
</div>

<!-- Reordering helps reveal patterns and relationships by arranging visual elements in ways that highlight similarities, differences, or trends. -->

# 3. Interaction<br> for Data Transformation

<!-- This section discusses how interaction enables users to transform the underlying data to gain different analytical perspectives -->

---

# Motives for Data Transformation

<div class="columns-2">
<div>

- Get clearer view of data
- Simplify display or data
- Reduce data amount
- Disregard excessive details
- Facilitate abstraction
- Normalize data for comparison

</div>
<div>


  <div class="interactive-chart" id="interactive-aggregation">
  </div>

  <div class="img-chart">
  <img src="img/DVVA_11/interactive_aggregation.png" alt="" height="400px"/>
  </div>

  </div>
  <script>
  insertChart('interactive-aggregation', './chart/DVVA_11/interactive_aggregation.json', '100%', '450px');
  </script>


</div>
</div>

<!-- Data transformation operations enable users to adjust data to better suit their analytical needs and reveal patterns that might otherwise be obscured. -->

---

# Types of Data Transformation

<div class="columns-2">

<div>

- **Discretization**
  - Convert continuous to categorical
  - Create class intervals

- **Logarithmic transformation**
  - Handle skewed distributions
  - Compare across orders of magnitude

# 4. Interaction for Data Selection and Filtering

<!-- This section covers techniques for selecting and filtering data to focus on relevant subsets -->

---

# Selection and Filtering
<div class="columns-2">
<div>

- **Selection:** Taking a portion of data to visualize it
- **Filtering:** Temporarily removing data of lesser interest

- Both require specifying properties of data interest
- Both enable detailed exploration of particular portions of data
</div>
<div>

  <div class="interactive-chart" id="selection-filtering">
  </div>

  <div class="img-chart">
  <img src="img/DVVA_11/selection_filtering.png" alt="" height="400px"/>
  </div>

  </div>
  <script>
  insertChart('selection-filtering', './chart/DVVA_11/selection_filtering.json', '100%', '450px');
  </script>
<!-- Selection and filtering are fundamental interaction techniques that help users focus on relevant data subsets while reducing complexity. -->

---

# Selection/Filtering Criteria

<div class="columns-2">

<div>

- **Attribute-based filter**
  - Select based on attribute values
  - Often uses sliders or range selectors

- **Temporal filter**
  - Position along timeline
  - Position in temporal cycle

- **Spatial filter**
  - Location on map or in space
  - Often uses drawing tools

</div>

<div>

- **Entity-based filter**
  - References to particular entities
  - Often uses search or lists

- **Relationship filter**
  - Connections to other data
  - Often uses network navigation

</div>

</div>

<!-- Multiple criteria can be used to select or filter data, allowing users to define precisely which data subset they want to focus on. -->

---

# Highlighting vs. Filtering

<div class="columns-2">

<div>

**Highlighting:**
- Data subset visually distinguished
- Remaining data still visible
- Shows selected items in context
- Enables pattern comparison

</div>

<div>

**Filtering:**
- Only shows data meeting criteria
- Removes other data from view
- Provides clearer view of subset
- Reduces visual complexity

</div>

</div>

<!-- Highlighting and filtering serve different analytical purposes: highlighting emphasizes selected data while maintaining context, while filtering focuses exclusively on the selected subset. -->

---

# Brushing
<div class="columns-2">
<div>

- Interactive technique for selecting/highlighting data
- Typically done by dragging mouse over display area
- Can also be done by clicking on visual marks
- Multiple highlighting modes:
  - Single item highlighting
  - Multiple selection highlighting
  - Temporary vs. persistent highlighting

</div>
<div>

  <img src="img/DVVA_11/brushing.svg" alt=""/>

</div>
</div>

<!-- Brushing is a common interaction technique that allows users to select and highlight data items directly through the visualization interface. -->

# 5. Relating Multiple Views

<!-- This section discusses techniques for coordinating multiple views to provide complementary perspectives -->

---

# Coordinated Multiple Views (CMV)

- Used when data components can't be effectively shown in a single display
- Allows looking at same data from different perspectives
- Coordinated views support finding corresponding information across displays
- Essential for complex data analysis

  <div class="interactive-chart" id="multi_display">
  </div>

  <div class="img-chart">
  <img src="img/DVVA_11/multi_display.svg" alt="" height="300px"/>
  </div>

  </div>
  <script>
  insertChart('multi_display', './chart/DVVA_11/multi_display.json', '100%', '450px');
  </script>

<!-- Coordinated multiple views allow users to see different aspects or representations of the same data simultaneously, with interactions in one view affecting others. -->

---

# Coordination Mechanisms

<div class="columns-2">

<div>

**Brushing and Linking:**
- Selection in one view highlights corresponding items in others
- Visual connection between related data across displays
- Supports identifying relationships

**Filtering:**
- Selection in one view filters data in all views
- Provides consistent focus across perspectives

</div>

<div>

**Common Symbolization:**
- Visual properties propagated between views
- E.g., colors, shapes, sizes
- Maintains consistent visual encoding

**Conditioning:**
- Creating multiple instances showing different data subsets
- Based on selections/categories from another view

</div>

</div>

<!-- These coordination mechanisms enable users to maintain connections between different visual representations of the same data. -->

---

# Example: Color Propagation

- Colors assigned to data in one view are applied to same data in other views
- Applications examples:
  - From choropleth map to scatterplot
  - From scatterplot to scatterplot
  - From map to histogram

  <div class="interactive-chart" id="color-propagation">
  </div>
  <div class="img-chart">
  <img src="img/DVVA_11/multi_color.svg" alt="" height="300px"/>
  </div>
  </div>
  <script>
  insertChart('color-propagation', './chart/DVVA_11/multi_color.json', '100%', '450px');
  </script>
<!-- Color propagation is a common technique for visual linking between different views, allowing users to track the same data items across multiple visualizations. -->



---

# Controlling Coordination

- Not all coordination is always desirable
- Too many linked changes can be:
  - Distracting
  - Resource-intensive
  - Overwhelming
- Systems may allow users to control:
  - Which displays are linked
  - What types of links exist
  - When coordination happens

<!-- User control over coordination is important for managing complexity and maintaining focus in multi-view analytical environments. -->

<div>

- **Cognitive and time costs:**
  - Requires learning interactions
  - Diverts attention to UI operations
  - Consumes analyst time

- **Lack of systematic approach:**
  - Hard to ensure comprehensive analysis
  - May rely too much on serendipity
  - Difficult to track explored elements

</div>

<div>

- **Performance issues:**
  - Slow updates with large datasets
  - Lag reduces analytical flow
  - Computational demands

- **Limited traceability:**
  - Difficult to record analysis process

</div>

<!-- While interaction provides many benefits, it also has costs and limitations that should be considered when designing visualizations and analytical workflows. -->

---

# Balancing Interaction and Computation

- Interaction consumes the analyst's time (valuable resource)
- Use should be well justified
- When possible, replace interaction with computation:
  - Automatic pattern detection
  - Pre-computed alternatives
  - Proactive preparation of likely views
  - Guided analytical pathways

<!-- The most effective approaches often combine interactive visualization with computational methods to minimize routine interactions while preserving exploratory freedom. -->

---

# Best Practices for Interactive Visualization

- Design for specific analytical tasks
- Minimize necessary interactions
- Maintain consistency in interaction patterns
- Provide visual feedback for interactions
- Support undo/redo and history
- Document the analytical process
- Balance flexibility with guidance

<!-- These best practices help maximize the benefits of interaction while minimizing its costs and limitations. -->
